Now you have registered, and you will get a mail at once with your user information. Check the e-mail
you used when you subscribed to The Kingdoms Of Chaos, you will get your password there. If you use
for instance Hotmail or some other free mail who has a spamfolder the mail will perhaps be laied there
by your mailprogram. Remember to check there if the mail from Chaos Admin @ tkoc.net doesn't lay in
your inbox. The message on the page now is to go to the login page to log in. After you have found your
password it's time to rock, so go to the login page. :)
<br><br>
Enter your username and the password. Press the login button. If you ever forget your password this is 
the page where you can get a new one. The most important information on this page is how long it's left
to the next tick. A tick is every hour and you can see the counter on the login-page.
<br>
<center><a href="#"><img src="/tutorial/img/provincelite.jpg"></a></center>
<br>
Fill in with Name of province (this is the name that will show up in the Kingdom list), this name can be
mostly everything. A band perhaps. Like the best band in the world, like I have taken ;) Ruler name is 
the name of your character, kind of like your first name. <br><br>
Gender is pretty easy. If you want to roleplay
as another gender you should think about what you select here. If not, select whatever you want to.
Race is one important thing. Remeber that I said you should start off with reading the guide? Well, here
is your first chance to make use of the facts that you found there. As you see, I decided to be elf
this time. I usually change from age to age to try new things, so if you don't like elf try some other
the next age.<br><br>
Now it's time to select a kingdom to be in. The list of kingdoms is sortet alfabeticly.
If you have been asked to join a specific kingdom just find it and type in the kingdom password if 
there is a password. If you are not asked to join a specific kingdom just scroll around to you find
a kingdom you want to join. Remark though, the kingdom must have less than 7 players (7 is max in a 
kingdom), and it can't be password-protectet if you don't know the password. If you want to make your
own kingdom by selecting New kingdom and type a New kingdom name for it. Random kingdom can also be 
choosen. <br><br>I strongly suggest that you join a kingdom with other players (random) the first time you play. That
way you get a bit protection since they work together with you, and you can all share what you learn 
about the game and so on. A full kingdom is stronger than a kingdom where you are alone... Press create.
