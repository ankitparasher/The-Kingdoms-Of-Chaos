The kingdom forum is where you may talk to all the others in your kingdom at once. Just make a name
for the thread, write something in the content, for instance who you are, what plans you will follow
this age in the game, and the timezone you are in so the others know when they can expect you to be 
online. Also SOP's (Scan of provinces) and such can be shared here. You deal with that yourselves :) The World Forum link
will bring you to the World Forum where every registered player may post. Read and post questions and such here, if
the people in your kingdom don't know the answer.<br><br>

This is how not to do it... Nice thing the admins have made an edit post option, so I can change
the post to be a speak of why I should be selectet as king!<br><br>
