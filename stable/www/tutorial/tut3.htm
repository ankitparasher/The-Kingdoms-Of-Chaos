Now you have finally logged into the game. Now it is time to look around on the menu and get familiar 
with where things can be found. We will start on the left side. Logout logs you out of the game, tutorial 
leads to this page, and preferences are where you may change password and e-mailadress and such. I suggest
that you change your password into something a bit easier... This is also the place where you may delete
your province if you get tired of the game.
<br><br>
Now, it's time for the real ingame menu. The fun stuff...
<br><br>
Remark that you have to place your mousepointer over the buttons and the menu will roll down for you to 
click. Pressing home will lead you to the page you are currently at. On this page you will get a lot of
the information about your province, but you can't really do anything here.
