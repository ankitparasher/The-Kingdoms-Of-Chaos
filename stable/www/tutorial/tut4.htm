The councilpage will show you available counclers for you to hire. The only one which is free is Lady
Brienne. <b>Hire Lady Brienne</b>. She will keep a track of your income for each day (tick) and month. After a while
you will most likely hire another councler wich will give you a race bonus to certain things. But they
are not free, so no rush for them yet.<br><br>

This is how your councilpage will look now. Check this once and awhile, if you get negative income in 
something you will see it here.<br><br>
