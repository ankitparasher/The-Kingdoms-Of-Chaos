Kingdom shows your kingdom and who is in it. The name of the province, how many acres he/she has, which
race they play, how much networth they have and how good a thief they are. As you see I am in protection
mode right now, it will last for 24 hours so noone can attack me right away.<br><br>
<center><a href="#"><img src="/tutorial/img/kdlite.jpg"></a></center><br>
The previous and next buttons means you can scroll through the other kingdoms in the game, to find a target
to attack or rob for instance. You may also type in a number and press the ok-button to go directly to
the kingdom which number you type in.<br><br>
Top 50 shows the leading provinces of the game. If you play much you may be on this list :)
<br>
<br>
Top 10 shows the leading kingdoms of the game. This is why it is important to make a strong kingdom.
<br><br>
Try to click on most things in here once you create your own province.  You will get a basic overwiev of the other kingdoms, and nothing 
dangerous can be done here.  Remember, you are in protection!<br><br>
