The thievery page is for thievery operations, this is where you go when you want to scan a province or rob his resources. Select
the kingdom and then the province, and then the operation you want to be done. Remark, you need to have thieves for this
to work :) If you want to be a good thief you need to have many many thiefes. A high TPA (Thieves Per Acre) is recommended
so the operations you want to be done will be done succsesful.<br><br>

The magic page is where you make your wizards work for their living. You may cast spell on yourself, people in your kingdom and
people in other kingdoms. Magic has many purposes, boost your income, harm other provinces, boost your kingdom mates income, 
protection against others and so on. Read about the spells available in the guide. If you want to be a great magician you
need to have a big WPA/MPA (Wizards Per Acre/Magicians Per Acre) ratio so your spell will do the most harm/best boost.<br><br>

The explore-page is one of the most important pages in the start of the game. To grow you need acres. In the start it's hard to attack
other players for acres, so you need to explore for them. Basicly what you need to do is to make recruits and send those
recruits out in the world to discover new land for your province. In the beginning exploring will get you lot of acres, but after
a while you need many recruits just to explore one lousy acres. Then it's time for your military and thieves to work together
and give you targets for more land. Land is the essence of growth, but if you have very much land and very little military
you will be attacked, and your precious land will be lost to your enemies.<br><br>
