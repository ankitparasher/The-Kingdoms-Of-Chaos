== Our wizards felt a great disturbance in the power today. They came to me with fear in their eyes, and demanded that I gave you this message. They say we will all die... ==

This is the message that shows up if someone is close to having researched the spell Apocalypse. 

Soon after, a message will appear saying which kingdom and which province has done it. 

No other real affect happens. This is the only knowledge that is publicly announced to everyone in-game.
