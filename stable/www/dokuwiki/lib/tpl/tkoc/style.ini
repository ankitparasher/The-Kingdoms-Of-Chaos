[stylesheets]
;screen
;note to myself: don't forget to respect the workaround within "csshelper.php"
;                when adding new screen styles.
;
;load the most important MediaWiki monobook styles after the dokuwiki ones
static/3rd/monobook/main.css = "screen"
;load the specific "monobook for dokuwiki" styles
static/css/screen.css        = "screen"
user/screen.css              = "screen"

;print
;note to myself: don't forget to respect the "print" action for the "printable
;                version" within "main.php" when adding new print styles.
;                I think this function is silly (cause therefore we got
;                different "media" but some poeple *always* searching for such
;                print version links). good text about this: http://is.gd/5MyG5
;                Addtionally, a look into "csshelper.php" would be no error.
static/css/print.css                 = "print"
static/3rd/wikipedia/commonPrint.css = "print"
user/print.css                       = "print"

;right-to-left
;note to myself: don't forget to respect the workaround within "csshelper.php"
;                when adding new rtl styles.
static/3rd/monobook/rtl.css = "rtl"
user/rtl.css                = "rtl"
