$mylanguage ["full-page"] = '<h3>The start..</h3>
	<p>It all started back in 2002, when the students of <a href="http://www.hig.no">Gjøvik University College</a> had to pick their main project for the last semester of school. 
	Anders having dreamt about making a game like this before, talked briefly with Øystein about the idea and concept of such a game. Øystein was very positive, so a few days later they asked Jørgen if he wanted to be part of the project.
	Jørgen said yes without hesitation, and the group and idea was born.</p>

	<h3>The first Concept and a new member..</h3>
	<p>The first concept was to make a similar game to what we have now, but instead base it on the Wheel of Time books. After a few emails (not actually reaching Robert Jordan) with Glen Dahlgren (project leader of Legend entertainment) we came to the conclusion that copyright issues was tricky, so we decided to make our "own" setting.
	While all of this was happening, we got a new addition to our group, Knut aka Turd. He was to be our designer (graphics).</p>

	<h3>Chaos is born</h3>
	<p>After heavy discussion, and throwing away a lot of ideas, we had designed the game with 1 attack, 3 races, 4 thievery ops, and a few magic ops. Now, they only thing left was to program it all...
	The first beta came out in april, we only told our friends, but still we reached 30-50 players quickly. We didnt have protection time back then or morale (unlimited number of attacks), so we had to reset pretty quickly.
	The second beta didnt have as many bugs, and we were able to correct them while we played. We had a lot more players now, nearly 100.</p>

	<h3>The first ages</h3>
	<p>The first ages, all, unfortunatly had bugs in them. We added new things and features that "almost" worked was corrected. It was still a success, almost doubling in size each age.</p>

	<h3>Death of chaos?</h3>
	<p>Our free server suddenly died in the summer of 2003. All of us were busy doing different stuff and the guy with the server, didnt have time to fix it. It looked like this was the end...</p>

	<h3>Chaos is reborn?</h3>
	<p>The server did came back online eventually. Anders tweaked the scripts, ordered www.tkoc.net as a domain, and took up the phone and started calling the other creators. A few days later (this was in august) we decided that it was important to try to get the game back online as soon as possible. We sent out emails to our previous players, and the age started with 50-100 loyal players.
	At this time Christian Nordstöm, took contact with Anders, asking if he could do some drawings for Chaos. Anders gladly accepted, so they took a meeting at a local cafè. Christian had some very impressive drawings, and the new design of Chaos started up.</p>

	<h3>A new look</h3>
	<p>Christian would prove to be very resourceful, and he had plenty of ideas on how chaos should look. It was an incredible new look, changing the whole feeling of chaos. Meanwhile, a new race (dwarves) was added, new attacks, new spells.. The council, the forum. Almost everything got a much needed owerhaul. (the world forum would, unfortunalty be painfully slow, together with a few more new bugs ;)</p>

	<h3>Now and the future</h3>
	<p>Finally we have our own logo (thanks to Christian). The code is clean, and its easy to add new features. We have a new (fast) world forum, and everything looks promising. Last age ended with 400 players, and hopefully it will all rise. In our dream we would like to get our own server dedicated for chaos, but that costs money (we dont have much of this :(). One thing is sure, we will continue with Chaos as long as we can! Sometimes, we\'re feeling uninspired, but be sure that at least one of us always has energy to keep chaos going.Happy hunting in the ages to come!</p>';
