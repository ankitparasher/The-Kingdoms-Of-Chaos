We've made this "disclaimer" short to make it easier for you to read it, so please do so before ticking the box below. The full rules of the game is in the guide.

We also recommend that you read through the guide and the tutorial before you register.

Rules of the Kingdoms of Chaos:
 
1. Have fun!
The main rule of this game is to have fun, but while you are having fun please remember the game is supposed to be fun for everyone. Totally ruining the fun for other players will not be tolerated.
2. You're not allowed to have more than one account / province.
Users caught in having several provinces will get all their provinces deleted and they'll be flagged as cheaters. If you have special requests, like you're a family playing from the same computer, contact the admins through the forum.
3. You have to enter a valid email.
Your password will be sent to the e-mail address you type, so make sure you're entering a valid one. As this is a non-profit game, originally made as a school project, we promise not to give your e-mail to anyone.
4. You have to enter correct information about yourself.
Users with bogus information will be deleted. We might include a special bonus or happening on your birthday, give stats on which countries our users are from and so on, but we promise not to give away any personal information either.
5. Behave.
Don't use your worst language/ words, don't name your province / kingdom / ruler or use banners that might count as racism etc. We want this game to be a game for everyone, children, adults, grandpa, so keep that in mind, and everything should be alright.
