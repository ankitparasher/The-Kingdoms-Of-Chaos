  * Added Norwegian language files
    Thanks to Henrik Karlstrøm :-) (see CREDITS for details).
    
  * Updated Japanese language files (fixed errors)
    Thanks to Yoshitaka Kunikane :-) (see CREDITS for details).
    
  * Added "/bug49642.php"
    This file provides a workaround for PHP bug #49642. For details, see the
    bugreport at <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=49692>. If you see errors like
    "syntax error, unexpected '/' in ../../lib/tpl/monobook/style.ini on line
    XX" in your logs, simply delete monobook's style.ini to trigger the usage
    of the workaround. Thanks to Marc and virk for reporting this.

  * Updated French language files (fixed errors)
    Thanks to Tamara Göbes :-) (see CREDITS for details).
    
  * Updated Japanese language files
    Thanks to Yoshitaka Kunikane :-) (see CREDITS for details).
    
  * Fixed some typos, minor improvements


2010-01-17  Andreas Haerter <andreas.haerter@dev.mail-node.com>
  * Added box examples in /user/boxes.php

  * Updated README regarding the usage of user defined boxes for the left column

  * Added comments in all .htaccess files (regarding file security)
    Commented the files to make sure that these additional Apache rules are not
    necessary to use monobook in a safe way. Additionally, some rules were
    updated to match newly created files in the /user directory.
    

2010-01-16  Andreas Haerter <andreas.haerter@dev.mail-node.com>
  * Created /user/boxes.php, /conf/boxes.php
    Left-column boxes are now configurable. See README for details.
    
  * Added new option $conf["monobook_mediamanager_embedded"]
    If enabled (=default), the mediamanager will be shown in the content area
    like a normal article (including navigation and stuff). If disabled, tabs,
    navigation and footer will be hidden to get a non-embedded, full-width
    media manager like it is known by the default DokuWiki template.

  * Added Japanese language files
    Thanks to Yoshitaka Kunikane :-) (see CREDITS for details).

  * Updated French language files
    Thanks to Tamara Göbes :-) (see CREDITS for details).
    
  * Created /VERSION
    Text file to make it easier for users to determine wich version of the
    monobook-template is installed. Updated /.htaccess rules to protect the
    file.

  * Fixed some IE only CSS-issues (no selected tabs, no icons in admin area)
    Thanks to Casper for reporting the bugs.

  * Added DokuWiki environment check in several files (e.g. language files)


2010-01-13  Andreas Haerter <andreas.haerter@dev.mail-node.com>
  * Created /user/tabs.php
    Own tabs should be defined at /user/tabs.php from now on to make updates
    easy going. See README for details.
    
  * Created /user/buttons.php, /conf/buttons.php
    Footer buttons/links are now configurable. See README for details.

  * Added Italian language files
    Thanks to Luigi Micco :-) (see CREDITS for details).

  * Removed second call of html_msgarea()
    Some people where confused when messages are showed both on top and bottom
    of the page. Thanks to Luis Machuca <gulix.cl> for reporting this.

  * Added "Export PDF" tab for the html2pdf plugin
    Thanks to Luigi Micco for submitting this (see the following for plugin
    info: <http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:html2pdf>).

  * Optional site notice was rendered outside the main content divs
    Therefore needed CSS classes were not applied to the rendered content of
    the class. Solution: moved deeper into the XHTML structure, inside
    <div id="bodyContent"><div class="dokuwiki">. Thanks to Luigi Micco for
    reporting this bug.

  * Added some CSS to mark missing "edit summary" input in the admin menu

  * Removed PHP code for Terence J. Grant's Google Analytics for DokuWiki
    The main.php took care about Terence J. Grant's Google Analytics for
    DokuWiki (see <http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:googleanalytics>), but I saw
    today, that this is simply not needed anymore (-> quote 2009-05-25: "Plugin
    is now an action plugin that requires no additional PHP code modification.
    Thanks to Mikhail I. Izmestev for this fix.)


2010-01-12  Andreas Haerter <andreas.haerter@dev.mail-node.com>
  * Using wl() instead of DOKU_BASE/DOKU_SCRIPT for link creation

  * Added French language files
    Thanks to Tamara Göbes :-) (see CREDITS for details).


2010-01-11  Andreas Haerter <andreas.haerter@dev.mail-node.com>
	* Renamed the template from "monodoku" to "monobook"
	  Michael (known as "chimeric", <chimeric.de>) contacted me on 2010-01-10
	  because he talked to Terence J. Grant <http://tjgrant.com/> to maintain
	  the template in the future (Terence does not have enough time to do this any
	  longer). After some investigation, he though about a rewrite... something I
	  already done with the release of "monodoku" ;-). After talking a bit, we
	  decided it is the best way to rename "monodoku" into "monobook" and provide
	  an upgrade path for the people who are using the no-longer-maintained
	  "Monobook for DokuWiki" by Terence J. Grant to get the things working
	  smoothly.
  
  * Rewriting CSS rules
    All new DokuWiki features are supported right now (e.g Link Wizard,
    downloadable code blocks...).

  * Fixed permanent link issue


2010-01-09  Andreas Haerter <andreas.haerter@dev.mail-node.com>
	* Initial release.
