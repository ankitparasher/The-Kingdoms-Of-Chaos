===== Military Upkeep =====


You will have to pay 0.6gc for every single military you have every tick.

So 10000 military will cost you 6000 gc every tick.


[expenses gold / 0.6 = total military]

[total Military * 0.6 = expenses gold]


You will have to pay 0.35kg food for every unit (sum at council) every tick.

So 10000 population will cost you 3500 kg food every tick.


[expenses food / 0.35 = total population]

[total population * 0.35 = expenses food] 


The food upkeep you see at the council page is the expense of the previous tickâ€™s population.
