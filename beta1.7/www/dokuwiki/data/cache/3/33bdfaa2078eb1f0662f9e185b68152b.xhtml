	<span class="sy0">&lt;</span>p<span class="sy0">&gt;</span>One of the most important factors of The Kingdoms of Chaos is it<span class="st_h">'s community and the interaction between the players.

	<span class="sy0">&lt;</span>p<span class="sy0">&gt;</span>The Kingdoms of Chaos is a strategy game where you are the ruler of a country<span class="sy0">,</span> or a Province <span class="kw1">as</span> we call it in the World of Chaos<span class="sy0">.</span> Your Province together with many other Provinces form a Kingdom<span class="sy0">.</span> Your kingdom is a team<span class="sy0">,</span> and working together increases the chances of success and greatness<span class="sy0">.</span> I suggest making allies of those within your Kingdom<span class="sy0">,</span> rather than opponents<span class="sy0">.</span> This allows access to trade and some element of protection<span class="sy0">.&lt;/</span>p<span class="sy0">&gt;</span>

	<span class="sy0">&lt;</span>p<span class="sy0">&gt;</span>Two playing styles are generally accepted within the community<span class="sy0">:&lt;/</span>p<span class="sy0">&gt;</span>
&nbsp;
	<span class="sy0">&lt;</span>p<span class="sy0">&gt;</span>The first is focusing on maximising growth of your province and Kingdom<span class="sy0">.</span> Province and kingdom ranking are the most important features in this style<span class="sy0">,</span> and ranking lists are provided to see how well you fare<span class="sy0">.</span> But beware<span class="sy0">,</span> others also play this style and will compete with you<span class="sy0">...&lt;/</span>p<span class="sy0">&gt;</span>
&nbsp;
	<span class="sy0">&lt;</span>p<span class="sy0">&gt;</span>The other style allows <span class="kw1">for</span> roleplaying within the realms<span class="sy0">.</span> Taking less care about rankings allows <span class="kw1">for</span> enjoyable and epic battles<span class="sy0">.</span> A roleplaying board is provided within the Chaos forums in order to assist those taking this approach<span class="sy0">.</span> Use this to talk to rulers of other Kingdoms<span class="sy0">,</span> or use your Kingdom<span class="st_h">'s own forum to communicate with your trade partners.&lt;/p&gt;
