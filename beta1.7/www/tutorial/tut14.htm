	<b>Conclusion:</b><br><br>
The way you want to play the game is for you to find out yourselves, you can choose to be attacker, magician or thief, or
perhaps a little of them all. But remember, the game is for fun so don't take it to serious. There are live human beeings
controlling every province in the game, remember that when you are interacting with them. Behave polite, interact so you get
to know the people playing the game, get tips and hints. Visit the <a href="http://www.tkoc.net/scripts/forum.php?forumID=6&threadID=88">IRC-channel</a>
and talk with admins and people who have played the games for ages, they can also answer questions for you.

Remember to have fun :)
