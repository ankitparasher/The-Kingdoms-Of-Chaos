On the page for trading you may aid your kingdom mates. Remember, you need to have military before you can 
send aid, and the reciver also need to have military before he/she can recive from you. This is a good
way to build a strong kingdom, by supporting eachothers.<br><br>
<center><a href="#"><img src="/tutorial/img/tradeliten.jpg"></a></center><br>
The Kingdom news shows who have been attacked or have attacked. Look here often so you can see how your
kingdom mates are doing. If someone is attacked it's a good thing for your kingdom to retaliate if
possible. Let the acres someone gain be expensive acres!<br><br>
