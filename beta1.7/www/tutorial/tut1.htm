So you have decided to join the TKOC world. There are some very few and easy step for how to take part
of this game. There are several choiches you may take, but I strongly recommend reading the guide as the very first
thing to do, because you have to select a race to be. To select the guide just press the button called
Guide.<br><br>
After the guide is read you want to register and start to play the game. Well, no suprise, you may do
that when you click the register-button.<br>
<center><a href="#"><img src="/tutorial/img/registerlite.jpg"></a></center><br>
Fill in with your name, country and so on. Beware of the "Login username" though, this username is the
one you will use when you want to log in, so better remember it :) Just to mention it allthough
it states clarely on the page. READ THE RULES. It won't take you long time and you will get to know
how to behave and how not to behave.
