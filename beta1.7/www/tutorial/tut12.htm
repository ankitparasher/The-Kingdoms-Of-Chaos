The attackpage is for attacking people. (Duuu'h) Select kingdom and province to attack, and the number
of military units you want to use in your attack. To attack it is best to scan a province with your thieves
first, so you know how much attackpoints you need to send out.<br><br>
<center><a href="#"><img src="/tutorial/img/attacklite.jpg"></a></center><br>
<b>From the guide:</b>
<br><br>
"Calculating points:	
<br>
To calculate your attack strength you take the number of troops you send, times the number of attack points for that particular unit. 
If you send: 
100 Human Recruits, it will make up a total of (num * points) 100*1 = 100 attack points. 
100 Human Rangers, it will make up a total of (num*points) 100*3 = 300 attack points. 
<br><br>
The defence points of your army (calculated in the same manner) will make your military losses lower. The greater the defence points you have in your attacking army, the fewer soldiers you will lose from attacking. The greater the attack points you have in your defending army, the more soldiers your attacker will lose as a result of attacking you. 
<br><br>
Since Thieves and Magicians were once soldiers too, they have some defensive/offensive skills. Ever hear of a burglar who could not defend himself? Ever hear of Magicians without spells to use in close combat? Their defensive/offensive skills will be used while defending your province against attacks."
<br><br>
On the attackpage you choose wheater you want to make an ordinary attack for acers or an massacreattack
just to harm. Massacreattack is not available before you get the proper knowledge for it. If you have little
acres and the one you attack have many acres you will gain more acres than if you are the one with lots of acres attacking a small province.
